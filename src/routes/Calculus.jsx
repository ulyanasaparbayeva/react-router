          the study of shape, and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.
          It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while the latter concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the
          fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.[1]
